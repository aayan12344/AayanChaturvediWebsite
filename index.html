            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated and driven Computer Science student at Virginia Tech, specializing in Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Analytics. With a consistent track record of academic excellence, as evidenced by my place on the Dean's List since Spring 2023, I have built a strong foundation in programming, system design, and advanced computational methods. My passion lies in leveraging technology to solve complex problems, particularly in the domains of data processing, natural language understanding, and secure system development.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout my journey, I have gained valuable hands-on experience through internships and leadership roles. As an intern at Abeyon LLC, I spearheaded the automation of processing over 300 GB of patent data, enabling the extraction of critical insights and reverse engineering of a patent search engine. I also developed a natural language question-answering system using Python and Whoosh, and applied cutting-edge NLP techniques with Mistral AI to enhance data analysis processes. My ability to collaborate with colleagues in agile environments has further refined my skills in project management and seamless integration of advanced technologies.</p>
           <p>Beyond technical expertise, I have honed my leadership capabilities as an active member of Lambda Phi Epsilon Fraternity at Virginia Tech. From successfully raising funds for charitable causes to developing risk assessment frameworks for event management, my roles have taught me the importance of teamwork, strategic planning, and community impact. Additionally, my experience as a Math, Reading, and Computer Science instructor at Kumon Math & Reading Center has equipped me with the ability to communicate complex concepts effectively, a skill I bring to both technical and non-technical collaborations.</p>
